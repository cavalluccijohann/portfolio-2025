# Elegant Patisserie Website

## Overview

A showcase website for a **modern patisserie**, designed to highlight each product in an **elegant and minimalistic** way.  
The project aimed to create a pleasant visual experience for visitors while providing the client with an easy-to-manage website.

## Design

I first created a **mockup on Figma**, aiming to best reflect the client’s vision.  
The design prioritizes simplicity, readability, and elegance to showcase the products effectively.
