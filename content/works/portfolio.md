#  A Creative Portfolio Experience

## Overview
This is my first portfolio project. I wanted to create something **simple yet effective**, while also making it **open source** so others could get inspired or use it as a base for their own portfolios.  
It includes all the essential features: a contact form, an “About Me” page, and a projects page.

## ️ Technologies Used

| Technology       | Role |

| **Nuxt.js**      | Front-end framework for fast and reactive rendering |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styling and responsive design |
| **Figma**        | UI/UX design and mockup creation |
| **Vercel**       | Full website hosting and deployment |
| **Resend**       | Contact email management |

## Challenges

- **Designing something that reflects who I am** – I wanted my portfolio to truly feel personal and represent me.
- **Owning my work** – At the time I built this portfolio, I only had a few projects. Publishing a portfolio with so little might seem risky or even “ridiculous,” but I realized you have to start somewhere.

---

## Conclusion

This project was an opportunity to build something that **represents me as a developer**.  
It gave me a space to showcase my work, no matter how small, and create a personal “vitrine” I can be proud of.  
This portfolio is very important to me, and I hope you enjoy discovering it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
