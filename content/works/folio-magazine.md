# A Creative Portfolio Experience

## Overview
This personal portfolio project aims to showcase my work in a **creative and intuitive way**, inspired by modern magazines.  
I wanted to make it **open source**, allowing others to get inspired or use it as a base for their own portfolios.  
Each “magazine page” is an individual PNG image, which means even users with **limited technical skills** can add their own pages and use it as their personal portfolio.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to practice **web development and design skills**, while creating a portfolio based on an idea I had and successfully realized.  
Going from concept to finished product is always rewarding, and I hope this project inspires other developers to explore **creative approaches** for their own portfolios.
