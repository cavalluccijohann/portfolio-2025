# A Creative Portfolio Experience

## Overview
This personal portfolio project aims to showcase my work in a **creative and intuitive way**, inspired by modern magazines.  
I wanted to make it **open source**, allowing others to get inspired or use it as a base for their own portfolios.  
Each “magazine page” is an individual PNG image, which means even users with **limited technical skills** can add their own pages and use it as their personal portfolio.

##  Technologies Used

| Technology       | Role |
|------------------|------|
| **Nuxt.js**      | Front-end framework for fast and reactive rendering |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styling and responsive design |
| **Figma**        | UI/UX design and mockup creation |
| **Vercel**       | Full website hosting and deployment |

## Challenges

- Designing an interface that **resembles a magazine** while remaining functional and easy to navigate.
- Ensuring a **responsive design** that keeps the magazine look consistent across all devices.

---

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to practice **web development and design skills**, while creating a portfolio based on an idea I had and successfully realized.  
Going from concept to finished product is always rewarding, and I hope this project inspires other developers to explore **creative approaches** for their own portfolios.
