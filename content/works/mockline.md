# Mockline – Modern UI component library

## Overview

**Mockline** is a modern, multi-framework component library, developed as a final-year project.  
The goal was to create a library similar to **NuxtUI** or **RadixUI**, but usable across **Nuxt, Vue, React, and Next**.

The ambition was to deliver a **modern, minimal design** combined with an excellent **DX (Developer Experience)**.  
The project was initiated and led by **HugoRCD**. While not 100% complete, it already provides a solid foundation with a clean structure, making it easy and practical to add new components.

## Technologies Used

| Technology            | Role |
|-----------------------|------|
| **TypeScript**        | Type safety and robustness |
| **Nuxt** / **Vue**    | Targeted front-end frameworks |
| **Next** / **React**  | Targeted front-end frameworks |
| **TailwindCSS v4**    | Modern and minimal styling |
| **Tailwind Merge**    | Tailwind class management |
| **Tailwind Variants** | Component variants management |
| **Turborepo**         | Monorepo and project organization |

---

## Challenges

- **Building the core foundation** of the library: ensuring new components could be added quickly and efficiently.
- **Multi-framework support**: managing compatibility across four environments (Nuxt, Vue, React, Next) in a single library.

---

## Conclusion

Mockline was one of the most ambitious projects we set out to build.  
Although we don’t plan to maintain it long-term, it was an incredibly valuable learning experience.

The project reached a **fully functional state for Vue and Nuxt**, while the **React and Next versions**, though working, were not as fully developed.

In short: an ambitious, challenging, and highly rewarding project that pushed us forward technically and gave us deeper insights into multi-framework development.
