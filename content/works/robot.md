# Flamethrower Robot â€“ Arduino Combat Bot

## Quick Overview

This project started as a simple challenge between two friends:

**Build a combat robot in 2 weeks, with less than â‚¬50. Each on our own!**

After a lot of brainstorming, I decided to go with a flamethrower.  
First, because wellâ€¦ itâ€™s cool  
And also because fire can slip into every little gap in the opponentâ€™s defenses.

But attack alone isnâ€™t enough â€” I also had to think about **defense**.  
I designed a **conical shape** to reduce grip points and deflect attacks, since I had no idea what my opponent was going to build.

> Hereâ€™s a first glimpse of the BEASTâ€¦

## Design & Components

Having the idea is one thingâ€¦ but how do you actually build it?

The first step was **a lot of research** to identify the most effective components while staying within the tight budget.

### Hardware Used

| Component                 | Description                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Arduino Uno**           | Main microcontroller                          |
| **HC-05**                 | Bluetooth module for remote control           |
| **L298N H-Bridge**        | Controls propulsion and motors                |
| **DC Motors + Wheels**    | Robot movement                                |
| **3D-Printed Tank**       | Fuel storage (isopropanol)                    |
| **Electric Arc Igniter**  | Ignition system for the flame                 |
| **18650 Batteries**       | Power supply                                  |

## Why These Choices?

- **Arduino Uno**: inexpensive, easy to program, perfect for prototyping.
- **Bluetooth (HC-05)**: simple integration, direct smartphone control.
- **L298N**: allows independent control of both motors (forward/backward/left/right).
- **3D Printing**: crucial for custom fuel tank and structural parts.
- **Arc Igniter**: reliable even in movement, remotely activated, stable ignition.

## 3D Printing

For this project, I modeled and printed most of the parts: from the robotâ€™s base to the pump that sprays fluid.  
I used **Fusion 360** for modeling, **Bambu Studio slicer**, and the **Bambu Lab P1P Mini** printer (amazing machine btw).

Here are some of the printed parts:

## Challenges Faced

- **Time**: 2 weeks working only in the evenings â€” really short, especially with a flamethrower system.
- **Power**: managing multiple components with a limited battery.
- **Budget**: everything had to be built from scratch (DIY pump, printed frame, etc.).
- **Electronics**: learning to handle power, safety, and proper integration.
- **The Pump**: designing a system able to propel fluid several meters.  
  I modeled it **from scratch**, and even though first tests were with water, it worked â€” a small victory!

## What I Learned

- How to integrate multiple Arduino modules
- Using Bluetooth in embedded projects
- Electronics basics: voltage, current, components, safety
- Managing a technical project under **real-world constraints**
- Fusion 360 modeling & improving my **3D printing skills**

## Electronics Schematic

Hereâ€™s a schematic of the electronic setup:  
*(Add a visual here: Fritzing, Lucidchart, or even a hand-drawn diagram)*

## Final Result

The robot is **fully functional**:

- Moves in all directions
- Controlled remotely via smartphone
- Flamethrower system works and is **safe**
- Respected the challenge: **< â‚¬50**, **< 2 weeks**

Butâ€¦ I still **lost** ðŸ˜…

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: if you ever set up this kind of challenge, agree on a **size and weight limit** to avoid unfair advantages!
