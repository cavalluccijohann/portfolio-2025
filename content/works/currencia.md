# Crypto Tracker â€“ Currencia

## Overview
Currencia is a platform designed to track cryptocurrencies with a clean and elegant interface.  
The application includes scripts to collect data from multiple sources such as **Kraken, CryptoCompare, and CoinMarketCap**, allowing for accurate and real-time information to be displayed.

Today, the application is no longer connected to its backend, but the UI/UX, dashboard, and data handling remain strong examples of the work achieved.  
Below are screenshots and a live demo preview.
