#  Automating Workflows

## Overview

**Helpr** is a platform designed to automate tasks by connecting various applications, allowing users to create powerful workflows with ease.  
By integrating tools such as GitHub, Gmail, Linear, or Slack, Helpr streamlines processes and helps teams focus on what really matters — building, not repeating.

This project was developed as part of a **team assignment at Epitech**, but we approached it as much more than just a school project.  
Our goal was to build something that could evolve into a **real SaaS product**, with simplicity and efficiency at its core.

## ️ Technologies Used

| Technology      | Role |
|-----------------|------|
| **Vue.js**      | Core JavaScript framework for building the UI |
| **Nuxt.js**     | Front-end framework for server-side rendering and routing |
| **Tailwind CSS**| Styling and responsive design |
| **Nest.js**     | Back-end framework for building scalable APIs |
| **Prisma**      | ORM for managing database interactions |
| **PostgreSQL**  | Relational database for storing application data |

---

## Challenges

- **Building value through actions & services**: we wanted Helpr to offer a wide range of integrations so that the platform would provide real utility to users.
- **Differentiating from Zapier**: at the time, we even added numerous actions powered by **OpenAI**, before Zapier themselves had integrated them!
- **Design & identity**: beyond functionality, we aimed to give Helpr a strong **visual identity** and a polished user experience, making it feel like a real SaaS product.

## Conclusion

This project was **led by Hugo RCD**, who introduced me to many of the technologies we used. It truly ignited my passion for working with modern stacks such as Vue, Nuxt, Nest.js, and Prisma.

Helpr was my **first large-scale project**, and it became a real turning point:
- I discovered how exciting it is to combine design, product thinking, and technical challenges.
- I learned an incredible amount about both front-end and back-end development.
- Most importantly, I gained the confidence to tackle ambitious projects.

We are **extremely proud of what we built** together, and I see Helpr as the project that sparked many of the skills and ambitions I continue to develop today.
