          Hello, my name is Johann, and I am a web developer based in Nice, France.<br><br>

          I am passionate about creation, mainly software and website development. I have always loved creating. From a young age, I would make all sorts of gadgetsâ€¦ and for the past 5 years, I have channeled this passion into development and design. I love imagining a project and bringing it to life by experimenting with and testing new technologies. I have learned to share this art by collaborating within a team.<br><br>

          I would describe my professional approach as an insatiable desire to learn by constantly taking on new challenges. I sincerely believe that every day is an opportunity to improve and become the person you aspire to be.<br><br>
